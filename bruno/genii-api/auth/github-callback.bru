  This endpoint handles the GitHub OAuth callback.

  GitHub will redirect to this URL after the user authorizes the application.
  The code and state parameters will be included in the query string.

  The server will exchange the code for an access token and create or update the user in the database.
  After successful authentication, the user will be redirected to the client application with access and refresh tokens.

  Note: This request should not be called directly from Bruno as it requires a valid code from GitHub.
  It's documented here for reference only.
