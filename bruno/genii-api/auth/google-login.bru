  This endpoint initiates the Google OAuth flow.

  When called, it will redirect the browser to Google's authorization page.
  After the user authorizes the application, Google will redirect back to the callback URL.

  Note: This request should be opened in a browser, not in Bruno, as it requires user interaction.
