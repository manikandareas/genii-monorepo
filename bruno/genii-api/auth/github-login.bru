  This endpoint initiates the GitHub OAuth flow.

  When called, it will redirect the browser to GitHub's authorization page.
  After the user authorizes the application, GitHub will redirect back to the callback URL.

  Note: This request should be opened in a browser, not in Bruno, as it requires user interaction.
